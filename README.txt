I recommend using Visual Studio Code to run this.

1. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code

2. Open console and use command "npm i" // this installs all the necessary node modules for the script to work.

3. Then you can navigate and open ./monster.fi/src/script.js

4. Once you have the script.js open you can follow the instructions there
